# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fix: the band stayed hidden after most turns on the desktop, whose end-of-turn box (recap,
  question, buttons) counts as a survey. The band now draws under it, without the next-step rows.
- New: the session archive. Every session's conversation is saved as it happens to
  `%USERPROFILE%\claude-session-archive\<session id>\` (`meta.json` and `rows-NNNN.jsonl`),
  for turning repeated work into skills later. `/archive` shows where; `sessionArchive` turns it off.
- New band layout: the full-width `── usage` / `── git` rules are gone. Each feature's rows sit
  beside a short dim label in a gutter (`usage │`, `git │`, `next │`), and the context ring closes
  the first row instead of taking one of its own.
- Next steps: hover a suggestion on desktop or VS Code to read its full prompt in a preview area
  under the list, which keeps its height so nothing moves. On the desktop the preview waits until
  the pointer has rested on a row for 200ms, follows it row to row, and stays while you read it.
- On the desktop, Commit and Push are text links instead of buttons.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-10-23

- The context ring now draws in the band above the prompt on desktop: the desktop app draws mod
  content only there and in panes, never in the prompt footer. The terminal keeps its `ctx N%` footer label.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-10-23

- One mod, `desktop-mods`, replaces three: commit-push (now the git bar), usage-meter and next-steps.
  Each feature switches on or off in the mod's options.
- New: the context ring, full at the auto-compact window (or the model's
  window, or `contextLimit`), with the numbers on hover; `ctx N%` on the terminal.
- Windows installer (`deploy\install.ps1`) for a checkout or straight from GitHub, which retires
  the old mods and moves the usage collector to a stable folder; uninstaller and options script.
- `tools\check.ps1`, `tools\package.ps1` (offline zip) and `tools\release.ps1` (version bump, tag, release).
